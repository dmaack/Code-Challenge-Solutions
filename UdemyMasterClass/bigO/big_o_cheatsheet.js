// Big Os


O(1) Constant - no loops
    O(log N) Logarithmic - usually searching algorithms have log(n) if they are sorted (Binary Search) (not on )

O(n) Linear - for loops, while loops
    O(n*log(n)) Log Linear - Sorting operations usually

O(n^2) Quadradic - every element in a collection needs to be compared to every other element - Two nested elements
    O(2^n) Exponential - recursive algorithms that solve a problem of size N

O(n!) - you are adding a loop for every element

** Iterating through half a collection is still O(n)
** Two separate collections: O(a + b)

What can cause time in a function?
    Operations (+, -, *, /)
    Comparisons (<, >, ==)
    Looping (for, while)
    Outside Function Call (function())
